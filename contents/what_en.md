## What is peritext ?

Peritext is a design research project dealing with academic publishing aiming to valorize the relation between an academic text and the digital resources it mobilizes. The goal is to valorize in a same movement, on the one hand, the mobilization of contextual elements coming from digital resources within the content of an academic document, and on the other hand to facilitate the integration of this very document in the global ecosystem of the web, its standards and spaces.

In order to achieve its ends, the project is about developing a set of technological modules related to the generation of multi-formats documents, and all articulated around the notion of contextualization. On one hand, Peritext is about composing academic documents that connect to their content the contextualizations of multiple external resources and staging them in a sophisticated manner. On the other hand it is about producing multimodal academic documents which can be contextualized for a diversity of formats and formats built for print, digital display or indexation.

Peritext modules can be assembled according to diverse configurations purposed for several use cases and publics. These diverse configurations all consist in allowing one or several author.s to generate, on the basis of a set of textual contents and resources, a family of web, print, and indexation-oriented documents. The author.s write.s their article / chapter / book once, and then have to their disposal various contextualizations of this very content for different formats (they can also realize specific formal fine-tuning for a specific format).

Apart from this multi-format dimension, Peritext’s specific features reside in the way it allows to involve numerous external elements in the argumentative structure of an academic text (references, data, audiovisual documents, etc.).

For that matter, in a Peritext document all the external elements being cited or quoted inside a given text (references, data, media, but also abstract lexicon entities such as persons, places, themes, ….) are equally taken as resources for which the mode of presentation and materialization is left to the author’s initiative : for instance, the same resource describing a data table can be in turns contextualized as a bibliographic resource, as a table, as a map (if this is allowed by data’s characteristics), a temporal visualization, etc.

Not only can the author specify the type of contextualization to apply to support her argument, she can also tweak a set of parameters in order to precisely build the contexutalization according to her needs (e.g. precise a text’s excerpt, highlight a certain dimension inside a dataset, set a specific view angle to the camera of a visualization, etc.). Thus she has the possibility to develop an argumentative discourse which is fully articulated around the mobilization of her resources.
