## Who can use Peritext ?

Peritext is a design project that, yet, is not about designing an specific object, document or application. It is rather about developing technological modules that allow for design-related issues and questions to be raised in the context of usual academic publishing situations.

In that sense, the publics of users of Peritext are meant to evolve as the project develops, from use cases demanding a very good knowledge of digital technologies, to more easily learnable and standardized use cases.
